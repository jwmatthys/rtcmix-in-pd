To install the binary, unzip and copy the entire folder to somewhere on your Pd search path. You will need the python-tk package installed to use the script editor. (On Debian: apt-get install python-tk)

To compile from source, first enter the RTcmix-pd-4.0.1.6 folder and ./configure; make clean; make. You'll need bison and flex; not sure what else.
Then, in the rtcmix-in-pd root folder, make clean and make; that's it.
