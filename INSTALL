To install the binary, unzip and copy the entire folder to somewhere on your Pd search path. You will need the python-tk package installed to use the script editor. (On Debian: apt-get install python-tk)

You'll need bison and flex; not sure if there's anything else.

To build:
```make rtcmix
make
```
