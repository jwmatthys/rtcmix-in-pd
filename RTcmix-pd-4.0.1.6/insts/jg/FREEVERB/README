This RTcmix instrument uses the Freeverb code by Jezar at Dreampoint
(http://www.dreampoint.co.uk/~jzracc/freeverb.htm), which is released
as public domain.

The Freeverb files are allpass.cpp, allpass.hpp, comb.cpp, comb.hpp,
denormals.h, revmodel.cpp, revmodel.hpp, tuning.h, and readme.txt.

Here are the changes I made to this source:

   - implemented pre-delay, including new delay class (delay.cpp, .hpp)

   - made a few "int i" declarations in some for loops in revmodel.cpp,
     just to keep egcs from complaining.

   - changed the names of the comb and allpass classes to fv_comb and
     fv_allpass, due to a namespace clash with RTcmix ugens.h.

   - changed revmodel::processreplace to accept separate input and output
     <skip> args, to mesh better with RTcmix buffer scheme.  (We're not using
     the processmix method, so no change there.)

Note that the units for the room size argument are unknown.  The maximum
is 1.07143..., because higher than that would make the feedback amount
for the comb filters greater than 1, and thus unstable.  With the room
size set to the max., the reverb time is infinite, I assume.
