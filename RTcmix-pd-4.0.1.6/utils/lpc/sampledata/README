sampledataset.lpc is a 24 pole analysis of
a male speaker acting silly.  It alrready
has the pitch analysis merged with it.

sampledataset.pch is the pitch analysis in 
of this same fool.

sampleplay.data is data for the instrument
lpcplay in ../synthesis
just say 
../synthesis < sampleplaydata.lpc

sampleplayin.data  is sample Minc data for
the same instrument, but using cross synthesis
