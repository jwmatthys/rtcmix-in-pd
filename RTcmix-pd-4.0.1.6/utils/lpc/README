hi there.

this is the sgi rtcmix port of the lpc instruments, as written by paul
lansky.

hope they work, now that i've de-fortranized the code.

documentation is in the docs directory.

all for now.

This doesn't compile with the current version of RTcmix, due to sndlib
changes and so forth. Haven't had a chance to update it yet.
