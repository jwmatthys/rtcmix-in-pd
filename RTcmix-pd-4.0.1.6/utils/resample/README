This is a modified version of Julius O. Smith's resample program
(version 1.2). It now uses Bill Schottstaedt's sndlib sound file
library. This means resample can read many different kinds of header.
The output file it writes is AIFF, big-endian, 16-bit linear, though
this can be changed to WAV, NeXT, or IRCAM in resample.c.

The command line switches have been changed somewhat from those
in the original program. This means the original README (README.orig)
is not quite accurate. Read "resample.doc" instead, or just invoke the
program with no arguments to get a usage summary.

The resample program handles only mono and stereo, 16-bit linear,
sound files. But since sndlib provides the application with 32-bit
signed data, no matter what kind of data the sound file contains, it
should be possible to read most any kind of data format. This hasn't
been tested though. (Note that if the input data were floating point,
it should be in normalized format, i.e., in the range (-1.0, 1.0).)

You can get the original resample-1.2 distribution from:
ftp://ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/NeXT.
