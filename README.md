RTcmix music language embedded in PureData

## Description

RTcmix is a real-time software language for digital sound synthesis and signal processing. Using a lightweight C-like syntax, it includes Perry Cook and Gary Scavone's Synthesis Toolkit, as well as advanced and unique signal processing instruments created by Brad Garton, John Gibson, Mara Helmuth and many others.

Run as a PureData external, RTcmix can be integrated with Pd's great patching and routing functions. It is also easy to distribute as a prepackaged binary, potentially reaching a wider audience.

This project is based on Brad Garton's rtcmix~ 1.81 for Max/MSP.
