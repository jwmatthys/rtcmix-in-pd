   lpcplot commands:\n
   1) n frame1 frame2\n
        will display frame1 to frame2.  If frame2 is 0 it will begin\n
        current chunk size on frame1.  If frame1 is negative it will\n
        backup that many frames and display current chunk size from \n
        there.  If neither frame1 or frame2 is specified it will\n
        simply display previous segment again.\n
   2) p frame1 frame2 mult botcps topcps\n
        Multiply the pitches of frames frame1 to frame2 by mult if the\n
        current pitch is >= botcps and <=topcps.  default for botcps\n
        and top cps are 0 and 999999.  If mult is 0 it will interpolate\n
        pitches in these frames according to the frequencies of frame\n
        frame1-1 and frame2+1.  If frame2 is 0 it defaults to frame1.\n
        Thus p 100 will simply replace the frequency of frame100 by \n
        interpolating between frames 99 and 101.\n
   3) v frame1 frame2 value.\n
        This will add value to the error numbers of frames frame1 toframe2.\n
        In this way you can force a voiced or unvoiced decision by \n
        subtracting 1 or adding 1, respectively.\n
   4) null line (blank space-return)\n
        this will simply display the next chunk of frames according to\n
        the currently defined chunk size.\n");
