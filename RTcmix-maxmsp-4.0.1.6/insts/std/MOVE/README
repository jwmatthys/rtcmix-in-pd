I have done a more complete port, including a major structural change to allow
buffer-based i/o rather than the previous sample-by-sample.  The hope is that
this will reduce cache hits, etc., and allow optimizing of copies and adds.

I have also ported MOVE, which now shares all common code directly with PLACE
(both inherit from the BASE instrument class).  PLACE will run in real time on
a 500mHz Pentium III Linux box.
